				<p>
					The largest contributing factor to our failing healthcare system is 
					a lack of proper funding. Public health funding makes up just around 10%
					of all health spending in most countries(Americas health ranking). While this is 
					a small amount, it can have a large impact when utilized correctly.
					The United States amount of funding is incredibly small compared to other countries,
					 with some reporting that only 3%  of our national health spending going to public
					  health. Here are few proposed solutions to increase the effectivity of the US's 
					  healthcare system.

                        <div class="bg-secondary rounded text-dark ">
                            <p>
                               All solutions to increasing the effectivity of public health care come with increased funding. As a nation, we spent 
                               $4.1 trillion on health in 2020 but only 5.4 percent of that spending targeted public health and prevention(Trust For America's Health).
                               This number should be drastically increased. As statd, most other countries spend 10% of their health care funding on public healthcare. Our first step
                               should be increasing our spending to around that level or better. These funds can come from voting through congress by increase taxes, preferably on the wealthy.

                        <div class="bg-secondary rounded text-dark">
                            <p>Federal Funds for public health are allocated on an annuel basis(National Library of Medicine).
                                This makes it difficult for state and local governments to plan strategically and makes it neat impossible to show the results of
                                newer programs. Thus an important part of the solution would be to increase the time between yearly budget changes. This would allow agencies to plan better 
                                allow us to see the positive results of programs before their funding gets cut.
                            </p>

                                Any increase in budget will come with heavy scrutiny from the public. Accountibility should be a cornerstone of public health funding(Trust for America's 
                                health). So any funding increase should come with full trancparency on how our tax dollars are spent. This will increase the respect given to public health
                                and make hesitant voters more confident in their budgets.
