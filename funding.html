				<p>
					The largest contributing factor to our failing healthcare system is 
					a lack of proper funding. Public health funding makes up just around 10%
					of all health spending in most countries(Americas health ranking). While this is 
					a small amount, it can have a large impact when utilized correctly.
					The United States amount of funding is incredibly small compared to other countries,
					 with some reporting that only 3%  of our national health spending going to public
					  health. Here are few proposed solutions to increase the effectivity of the US's 
					  healthcare system.

                            <p>A major negative of the Healthcare field is the commute to and from work. Traffic in urban areas can be a 
                                nightmare and hospitals barely have any parking available. This can be solved by providing more parking at hospitals as well as grant greater access to public 
                            transportation</p>

                            <p>One of the largest contributing factors of people not wanting to go into healthcare is the cost of medical school. The average cost of medical
                                school today is $230,296(educationdata.org). This can be an extremely large barrier of entry
                                for college age students. So the last step in increasing the healthcare workforce would be to make
                                medical school more affordable for all.
